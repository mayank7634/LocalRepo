**Here are some Step Which i have Applied :**

First of of all make a Github Repo
Second make a clone
Third make a change
Forth add
fifth commit
sixth push the repo

**Here some Step I have add ** :-

Cd means **Change Directory **
To Check Version  **git --version**
configuring Git  **git config --global user.name" Mayank"**
                2nd   **git config --global user.email" mayanktiwari763499@gmail.com" **      
                3rd    **git config --list **

** For clone Status **


git clone <- my repo link ->

status display use the  **git status
**
After that :
First  Go to the Github and then create repo and then go the HTTPS and copy the link and paste the link on the terminal line 
use the command that is   **git clone  paste your link  HTTPS Link here **

**After that Add & Commit **

The command is **git add <file name >**
and if i have many file to add in multiplay time we can use this commad that is  **git add .**

After That commit the record 
use the commad that is  **git commit -m "add here what i am add in any file we shoud write here the change "
**
 After that we have to Push Your File in Github so we have to push Our File using Push Commands
and the commad is **git push  origin main **

after that i am using the **set upstream **
**using the commds  git push -u origin main
**

**After that using Init Commands **

**git init 
git remote add origin <link > before this i am making a repo new that is localrepo 
git remote -v (To verify remote)
git branch (To check  branch )
git branch -M main (  to rename branch )
git push origin main **

using this i have make my Project i have explain all the thing which   i have applied on this project 

these are the step which i have applied!
